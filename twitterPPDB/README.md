TwitterPPDB
------

The TwitterPPDB dataset is a whole new dataset, it is also the largest human-labeled paraphrase corpus  to date of 51,524 sentence pairs and the first cross-domain benchmarking for automatic paraphrase identification, textual similarity, and also question answering tasks. It was first released and then organized by the following papers:

+  Wuwei Lan, Siyu Qiu, Hua He and Wei Xu. [A Continuously Growing Dataset of Sentential Paraphrases.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00391.pdf) *EMNLP 2017*.

For convenience, this dataset has been preprocessed and prepared by hohoCode, thus it has exactly the same data format as all other datasets in this Github repo. So simply just plug it into your model and have fun playing it!

Our Very Deep Pairwise Word Interaction Model (as published in NAACL2016) is currently the SOTA, but it should be easy to come up with new models to beat the NAACL16 model! Have FUN.
